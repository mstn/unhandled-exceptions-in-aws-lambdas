Notes

* we return `{ statusCode: number, body: string }` since it is what it is expected by API Gateway. Otherwise, we get `{"message": "Internal server error"}`. Other ways to invoke lambdas might require different return values.
* Runtime `nodejs12.x` (latest January 2020)


curl `/functions/1`

* `try-catch` everything/force `TypeError`
* Return `{}`
* CloudWatch `INFO ERROR {}`
* Lost info about error

curl `/functions/2`

* Don't `try-catch`/force `TypeError`
* Return `{"message": "Internal server error"}`
* CloudWatch ` ERROR Invoke Error {"errorType":"TypeError","errorMessage":"Cannot read property 'someProperty' of undefined"...`
* We get a clear description of the error

curl `/functions/3`

* `try-catch` everything/force `TypeError`
* Return `{}`
* CloudWatch `INFO ERROR {}`
* Lost info about error

curl `/functions/4`

* `try-catch` everything/explicit `throw`
* Return `{}`
* CloudWatch `INFO ERROR {}`
* Lost info about error

curl `/functions/5`

* `try-catch` everything/explicit `throw`
* Return `{}`
* CloudWatch `INFO ERROR {}`
* Lost info about error


> "Depending on the event source, AWS Lambda might retry the failed Lambda function. For example, if Kinesis is the event source, AWS Lambda retries the failed invocation until the Lambda function succeeds or the records in the stream expire." [1]
* `Asynchronous invocation â€“ Lambda retries function errors twice` [3]. 
* We should pay attention if some side effects are executed inside the lambda. Field `context.awsRequestId` [4] is what we are interested in if the lambda is not idempotent. More strategies in [4] (in memory data store, step functions).
